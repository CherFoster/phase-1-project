<h1>Beginner's Workout App</h1>
Beginner's Workout App created by Cherise Foster for Flatiron School's Phase 1 Project

<h2>Description:</h2>
If you are new to the gym, take away some of the uneasiness of not knowing what workouts to do with the Beginner's Workout App! It allows you to search workouts that are specific to a certain muscle group. 

<h3>You can:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Search for a workout to target specific muscle groups.</li>
<li>"Like" your favorite workouts so that you can refer back to them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started:</h2>
The Beginner's Workout App connects to a full fake REST API using a db.json file. To install the server, go to your terminal and type in:
<code>npm install -g json-server</code>
To start the JSON server, type in:
<code>json.server --watch db.json
You can view the db.json data by opening <code>http://localhost:3000/workouts</code> in your browser, which is located under "Resources" in the terminal.
